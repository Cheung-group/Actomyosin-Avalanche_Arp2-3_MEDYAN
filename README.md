### Chengxuan Li, August 2025

## MEDYAN software

See https://medyan.org/ for the original software information. Chengxuan used version v3.2 for the simulations in this work.

## analyze script

Chengxuan used Python 3.8 to run AnalyzeTrajectory.py to convert MEDYAN simulation trajectories into arrays easy for analysis in later steps.
